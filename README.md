## Core Functionalities (5+ required)

### 1. User Registration & Verification
- Member registration with college ID
- Profile verification system
- Role-based access (Student, Faculty, Staff, Admin)
- Profile management

**SQL Examples**:
```sql
-- Register new member
INSERT INTO Member (Name, Email, ContactNumber, Age, CollegeID, Department)
VALUES ('John Doe', 'john.doe@iitgn.ac.in', '9876543210', 20, 'IITGN2023001', 'Computer Science');

-- Verify member
UPDATE Member SET IsVerified = TRUE WHERE CollegeID = 'IITGN2023001';

-- Get all verified members
SELECT * FROM Member WHERE IsVerified = TRUE;
```

### 2. Content Sharing & Engagement
- Create, edit, delete posts
- Add comments on posts
- Like posts and comments
- Media attachments support

**SQL Examples**:
```sql
-- Create post
INSERT INTO Post (MemberID, Content, MediaType, Visibility)
VALUES (1, 'Hello IITGN! Excited to join this platform!', 'None', 'Public');

-- Add comment
INSERT INTO Comment (PostID, MemberID, Content)
VALUES (1, 2, 'Welcome to the platform!');

-- Like a post
INSERT INTO `Like` (MemberID, TargetType, TargetID)
VALUES (3, 'Post', 1);

-- Get post with engagement stats
SELECT p.*, m.Name AS AuthorName, p.LikeCount, p.CommentCount
FROM Post p
JOIN Member m ON p.MemberID = m.MemberID
WHERE p.PostID = 1;
```

### 3. Social Connections
- Follow/unfollow users
- View followers and following
- Track connection growth

**SQL Examples**:
```sql
-- Follow a user
INSERT INTO Follow (FollowerID, FollowingID)
VALUES (1, 2);

-- Get follower count
SELECT COUNT(*) AS FollowerCount
FROM Follow
WHERE FollowingID = 2;

-- Get following count
SELECT COUNT(*) AS FollowingCount
FROM Follow
WHERE FollowerID = 1;

-- Get user's followers
SELECT m.*
FROM Member m
JOIN Follow f ON m.MemberID = f.FollowerID
WHERE f.FollowingID = 2;
```

### 4. Content Moderation & Reporting
- Report inappropriate content
- Review and resolve reports
- Track moderation actions
- Admin review workflow

**SQL Examples**:
```sql
-- Report a post
INSERT INTO Report (ReporterID, ReportedItemType, ReportedItemID, Reason)
VALUES (5, 'Post', 10, 'Spam content with irrelevant links');

-- Admin reviews report
UPDATE Report
SET Status = 'Reviewed', ReviewedBy = 3, ReviewDate = NOW(),
    Action = 'Post removed'
WHERE ReportID = 1;

-- Get pending reports
SELECT r.*, m1.Name AS ReporterName
FROM Report r
JOIN Member m1 ON r.ReporterID = m1.MemberID
WHERE r.Status = 'Pending';
```

### 5. Group Management
- Create campus groups
- Join/leave groups
- Role-based group management (Admin, Moderator, Member)
- Category-based organization

**SQL Examples**:
```sql
-- Create group
INSERT INTO `Group` (Name, Description, CreatorID, Category)
VALUES ('Coding Club IITGN', 'Programming enthusiasts community', 1, 'Tech');

-- Add member to group
INSERT INTO GroupMember (GroupID, MemberID, Role)
VALUES (1, 2, 'Member');

-- Get all groups a member belongs to
SELECT g.*
FROM `Group` g
JOIN GroupMember gm ON g.GroupID = gm.GroupID
WHERE gm.MemberID = 1 AND gm.IsActive = TRUE;
```

### Bonus: Direct Messaging & Notifications
- Send direct messages
- Real-time notifications
- Activity logging

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites:
- MySQL 5.7+ or MariaDB 10.3+
- MySQL Workbench (optional, for visualization)

### Setup Instructions:

1. **Create Database**:
```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

2. **Import SQL Dump**:
```sql
source college_social_media_dump.sql
```

Or via command line:
```bash
mysql -u root -p < college_social_media_dump.sql
```

3. **Verify Installation**:
```sql
USE college_social_media;
SHOW TABLES;

-- Check row counts
SELECT 'Member' as TableName, COUNT(*) as RowCount FROM Member
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Post', COUNT(*) FROM Post;
```

## Sample Queries

### Query 1: Get Most Active Users
```sql
SELECT m.Name, m.Email,
       COUNT(DISTINCT p.PostID) AS PostCount,
       COUNT(DISTINCT c.CommentID) AS CommentCount,
       COUNT(DISTINCT l.LikeID) AS LikeCount
FROM Member m
LEFT JOIN Post p ON m.MemberID = p.MemberID
LEFT JOIN Comment c ON m.MemberID = c.MemberID
LEFT JOIN `Like` l ON m.MemberID = l.MemberID
GROUP BY m.MemberID
ORDER BY (PostCount + CommentCount + LikeCount) DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Query 2: Get Popular Posts
```sql
SELECT p.PostID, m.Name AS Author, p.Content,
       p.LikeCount, p.CommentCount,
       (p.LikeCount * 2 + p.CommentCount) AS PopularityScore
FROM Post p
JOIN Member m ON p.MemberID = m.MemberID
WHERE p.IsActive = TRUE
ORDER BY PopularityScore DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Query 3: Get Group Statistics
```sql
SELECT g.Name, g.Category, g.MemberCount,
       COUNT(DISTINCT gm.MemberID) AS ActualMemberCount,
       m.Name AS Creator
FROM `Group` g
JOIN Member m ON g.CreatorID = m.MemberID
LEFT JOIN GroupMember gm ON g.GroupID = gm.GroupID AND gm.IsActive = TRUE
GROUP BY g.GroupID
ORDER BY g.MemberCount DESC;
```

### Query 4: Get User's Social Network
```sql
-- Get followers and following for a specific user
SELECT
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Follow WHERE FollowingID = 1) AS Followers,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Follow WHERE FollowerID = 1) AS Following,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Post WHERE MemberID = 1) AS Posts,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Comment WHERE MemberID = 1) AS Comments;
```

### Query 5: Get Pending Moderation Reports
```sql
SELECT r.ReportID, r.ReportedItemType, r.ReportedItemID,
       m1.Name AS Reporter, r.Reason, r.ReportDate
FROM Report r
JOIN Member m1 ON r.ReporterID = m1.MemberID
WHERE r.Status = 'Pending'
ORDER BY r.ReportDate ASC;
```

## Security & Constraints

### CHECK Constraints:
- Age: 16 ≤ Age ≤ 100
- Email format: Must contain '@' and '.'
- No self-following: FollowerID ≠ FollowingID
- No self-messaging: SenderID ≠ ReceiverID
- Positive counts: LikeCount, CommentCount ≥ 0
- Content validation: Non-empty strings

### UNIQUE Constraints:
- Member: Email, CollegeID
- Follow: (FollowerID, FollowingID)
- Like: (MemberID, TargetType, TargetID)
- GroupMember: (GroupID, MemberID)

### Referential Integrity:
- CASCADE DELETE: When a member is deleted, dependent data is removed
- SET NULL: When a reviewer is deleted, reports remain but reviewer is cleared
- ON UPDATE CASCADE: Key updates propagate to dependent tables

---

## Performance Optimization

### Indexes Created:
- Member role filtering
- Post member and date lookups
- Comment lookups by post and member
- Like target lookups
- Follow relationship queries
- Report status filtering
- Message receiver inbox queries
- Notification member lookups
- Activity log member and timestamp ordering
